```


First, I show the estimated nest counts for Jamursba-Medi (JM) and Wermon (W) when the model with one slope and one variance was used.  Because the two datasets were combined, there are estimated counts for the years without data at Wermon.  When two separate analyses were coducted for the two beaches, the estimates for the missing data years are absent.  

```{r singleUQ_JM_trend, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Estimated (black is imputed median, blue line and green band are from exponential population growth model) and observed (red) nest counts at Jamursba-Medi nesting beach. ", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/JM_trend_annual_log.png")
```


```{r singleUQ_W_trend, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Estimated (black is imputed median, blue line and green band are from exponential population growth model) and observed (red) nest counts at Wermon nesting beach. ", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/W_trend_annual_log.png")
```

Although different model and data combinations (e.g., using each beach separately, assuming two slope, etc.) result in slightly different results, specifically widths of 95% credible bands, the overall results are essentially the same.

In the following, I will present the posterior distributions of the slope parameters for each question. 


(1) A separate trend each for Jamursba-Medi (JM) and Wermon (W) using data for April to March each year to compare with Tapilatu et al.

There are a couple ways to tackle this question. One is to analyze two datasets separately and estiamte the trend for each dataset.  Another is to use both datasets simultaneously but obtain two separate trends, while using information from the two datasets. All analyses have been completed in trend_analysis.Rmd and other scripts that are referenced in it.  Here, I just bring out the results and create this document.  To update the results, I need to run other scripts before updating this document. 

(1a) Using two datasets independently

(1a - Jamursba-Medi)

```{r JM_find_results, echo=FALSE}
JM_only.out <- readRDS(file = paste0("Rdata/singleUQ_JM_only_", 
                                begin.year, "_", end.year,  "_", run.date, ".rds"))
JM.U.f <- signif(JM_only.out$out$summary["U", "f"], 3) * 100
```

The majority (```r JM.U.f ``` %) of the slope was less than 0, indicating a strong likelihood of decline for JM.  The median of the slope was ```r signif(JM_only.out$out$summary["U", "50%"], 2)``` and its 95% CI = [```r signif(JM_only.out$out$summary["U", "2.5%"], 2)```, ```r signif(JM_only.out$out$summary["U", "97.5%"], 2)```].

```{r posterior_U_JM_only, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Posterior distribution of the slope parameter for JM, when the only one dataset was used.", out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/posterior_U_JM_only.png")
```


(1a - Wermon)

Because there were no data prior to 2006, the analysis was conducted only from 2006. 

```{r W_find_results, echo=FALSE}
W_only.out <- readRDS(file = paste0("Rdata/singleUQ_W_only_2006_", 
                                end.year,  "_", run.date, ".rds"))
W.U.f <- signif(W_only.out$out$summary["U", "f"], 3) * 100
```

The majority (```r W.U.f ``` %) of the slope was less than 0, indicating a strong likelihood of decline for W.  The median of the slope was ```r signif(W_only.out$out$summary["U", "50%"], 2)``` and its 95% CI = [```r signif(W_only.out$out$summary["U", "2.5%"], 2)```, ```r signif(W_only.out$out$summary["U", "97.5%"], 2)```].

```{r posterior_U_W_only, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Posterior distribution of the slope parameter for W, when the only one dataset was used.", out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/posterior_U_W_only.png")
```


(1b) Using two datasets together

```{r get_indU_singleQ_results, echo=FALSE}
jags.model <- readRDS(file = "RData/independentUs_singleQ_out_2001_2018_2019-03-14.rds")
```

For the two beaches, ```r signif(jags.model$out$summary["U[1]", "f"], 3) * 100``` and ```r signif(jags.model$out$summary["U[2]", "f"], 3) * 100``` % of the posteriors were < 0, indicating strong evidence of population decline. Medians and 95% CIs were JM = ```r signif(jags.model$out$summary["U[1]", "50%"], 2)``` (```r signif(jags.model$out$summary["U[1]", "2.5%"], 2)```, ```r signif(jags.model$out$summary["U[1]", "97.5%"], 2) ```) and W = ```r signif(jags.model$out$summary["U[2]", "50%"], 2)``` (```r signif(jags.model$out$summary["U[2]", "2.5%"], 2)```, ```r signif(jags.model$out$summary["U[2]", "97.5%"], 2)```)

```{r plot_posterior_Us, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Posterior distributions of the slope parameters when two datasets were used simultaneously (U[1] = Jamursba-Medi, U[2] = Wermon", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/posterior_Us.png")
```


(2) A combined JM + W data trend using April to March data for each year

Analyzing these datasets with a single slope provides the best statistical treatment, rather than summing numbers of two time series. 

```{r get_singleUQ_out, echo=FALSE}
singleUQ_out <- readRDS(paste0("RData/singleUQ_out_", 
                               begin.year, "_", end.year, 
                               "_", run.date, ".rds"))

```

The assumption in this analysis is that there is only one slope for two beaches. 

The majority of the slope parameter was less than 0 ( ```r signif(singleUQ_out$out$summary["U", "f"], 3) * 100```%), indicating evidence of decline.  The median of the slope was ```r signif(singleUQ_out$out$summary["U", "50%"], 2)```, 95% CI =  [```r signif(singleUQ_out$out$summary["U", "2.5%"], 2)```, ```r signif(singleUQ_out$out$summary["U", "97.5%"], 2)```].

```{r posterior_U_singleUQ, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Posterior distribution of the slope parameter when two datasets were used simultaneously with one-slope and one-variance model", out.width="50%"}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/posterior_singleU.png")
```



(3) A separate trend each for JM and W for the summer months (1 April  - 30 Sep) 

As it was done for the total annual counts, this can be done with independent datasets or use them together in one analysis using a two-slope model.  

(3a) Using two datasets separately

(3a - Jamursba-Medi)

```{r get_JM_only_summer, echo=FALSE}
JM_singleUQ_summer <- readRDS(file = paste0("Rdata/singleUQ_JM_only_summer_", 
                                            begin.year, "_", end.year,  "_", run.date, ".rds"))
```

```{r JM_only_trend_summer_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Estimated (black is imputed median, blue line and green band are from exponential population growth model) and observed (red) nest counts during summer months at Jamursba-Medi nesting beach when only JM data were used.", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/JM_only_trend_summer_log.png")
```

The majority (```r signif(JM_singleUQ_summer$out$summary["U", "f"], 3) * 100 ``` %) of the slope was less than 0, indicating a strong likelihood of decline for JM during summer months. The median and 95% CI of the slope were ```r signif(JM_singleUQ_summer$out$summary["U", "50%"], 2)```  (```r signif(JM_singleUQ_summer$out$summary["U", "2.5%"], 2)```,  ```r signif(JM_singleUQ_summer$out$summary["U", "97.5%"], 2)```).

```{r posterior_U_JM_only_summer, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Posterior distribution of the slope parameter for summer months in JM, when only one dataset was used.", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/posterior_U_JM_only_summer.png")
```


(3a - Wermon)
```{r get_W_only_summer, echo=FALSE}
W_singleUQ_summer <- readRDS(file = paste0("Rdata/singleUQ_W_only_summer_2006_", 
                                            end.year,  "_", run.date, ".rds"))
```

```{r W_only_trend_summer_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Estimated (black is imputed median, blue and green band are from exponential population growth model) and observed (red) nest counts during summer months at Wermon nesting beach when only W data were used.", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/W_only_trend_summer_log.png")
```

The majority (```r signif(W_singleUQ_summer$out$summary["U", "f"], 3) * 100 ``` %) of the slope was less than 0, indicating evidence of decline for W during summer months but less so than summer months in JM. The median of the slope was ```r signif(W_singleUQ_summer$out$summary["U", "50%"], 2)``` and its 95% CI [```r signif(W_singleUQ_summer$out$summary["U", "2.5%"], 2)```,  ```r signif(W_singleUQ_summer$out$summary["U", "97.5%"], 2)```].

```{r posterior_U_W_only_summer, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Posterior distribution of the slope parameter for summer months in W, when only one dataset was used.", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/posterior_U_W_only_summer.png")
```


(3b) Using two datasets simultaneously with two independent slopes
```{r get_indUs_summer, echo=FALSE}
indUs_summer <- readRDS("RData/independentUs_singleQ_summer_out_2001_2018_2019-03-14.rds")
```

For the two beaches, ```r signif(indUs_summer$out$summary["U[1]", "f"], 3) * 100``` and ```r signif(indUs_summer$out$summary["U[2]", "f"], 3) * 100``` % of the posteriors were < 0, indicating evidence of population decline. Medians and 95% CIs were JM = ```r signif(indUs_summer$out$summary["U[1]", "50%"], 2) ``` (```r signif(indUs_summer$out$summary["U[1]", "2.5%"], 2) ```,  ```r signif(indUs_summer$out$summary["U[1]", "97.5%"], 2) ```) and W = ```r signif(indUs_summer$out$summary["U[2]", "50%"], 2) ``` (```r signif(indUs_summer$out$summary["U[2]", "2.5%"], 2) ```, ```r signif(indUs_summer$out$summary["U[2]", "97.5%"], 2) ```)

```{r create_posteriorUs_summer, echo=FALSE}

p.1 <- bayesplot::mcmc_dens(indUs_summer$out$samples, c("U[1]", "U[2]"))
p.1 <- p.1 + labs(y = "Density")

if (!file.exists("figures/posterior_Us_summer.png"))
  ggsave(p.1,
         filename = "figures/posterior_Us_summer.png",
         device = "png",
         dpi = 600)

```


```{r posterior_Us_summer, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Posterior distributions of the slope parameters for summer months U[1] = JM, U[2] = W", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/posterior_Us_summer.png")
```


(4) a combined trend for the summer for JM + W (this is to look at the impact of fisheries since many of these animals come across to the US West coast)

This analysis is for using one slope and one variance parameters for the two beaches in summer months. 

```{r get_singleUQ_summer, echo=FALSE}
singleUQ_summer <- readRDS("RData/singleUQ_summer_out_2001_2018_2019-03-14.rds")

```

For the two beaches, ```r signif(singleUQ_summer$out$summary["U", "f"], 3) * 100``` % of the posterior was < 0, indicating strong evidence of population decline. Medians and 95% CIs were ```r signif(singleUQ_summer$out$summary["U", "50%"], 2) ``` (```r signif(singleUQ_summer$out$summary["U", "2.5%"], 2) ```,  ```r signif(singleUQ_summer$out$summary["U", "97.5%"], 2) ```). 

```{r posterior_U_summer, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Posterior distributions of the slope parameter for summer months using one-slope one-variance model", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/posterior_U_summer.png")
```


(5) A separate trend each for the summer months (1 April  - 30 Sep) in Wermon and the winter months (1 October - March 31) in Wermon because the thinking has been that while winter nesting in Wermon is decreasing, the summer nesting in Wermon is increasing. Also the winter nesting trend can be used to evaluate impact of fisheries for these animals heading south.

Trend analysis for summer months in Wermon has been completed in the (3) above. Here I look at the winter months using data from Wermon only. 

```{r get_W_only_winter, echo=FALSE}
W_singleUQ_winter <- readRDS(file = paste0("Rdata/singleUQ_W_only_winter_2006_", 
                                            end.year,  "_", run.date, ".rds"))
```

```{r W_only_trend_winter_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Estimated (black is imputed median, blue line and green band are from exponential population growth model) and observed (red) nest counts during winter months at Wermon nesting beach when only W data were used.", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/W_only_trend_winter.png")
```


```{r posterior_U_W_only_winter, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Posterior distribution of the slope parameter for winter months in W, when the only one dataset was used.", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/posterior_U_W_only_winter.png")
```

The majority (```r signif(W_singleUQ_winter$out$summary["U", "f"], 3) * 100 ``` %) of the slope was less than 0, indicating a strong likelihood of decline for W during winter months. The median of the slope was ```r signif(W_singleUQ_winter$out$summary["U", "50%"], 2)``` and its 95% CI [```r signif(W_singleUQ_winter$out$summary["U", "2.5%"], 2)```,  ```r signif(W_singleUQ_winter$out$summary["U", "97.5%"], 2)```].
