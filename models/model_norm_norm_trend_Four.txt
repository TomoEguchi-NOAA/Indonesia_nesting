# For this model, the natural log of raw counts were used as data (y). The state model
# is normal and the observation model is norm. The probability of nesting in a month
# is modeled with a discrete Fourier series - p[month] sums to 1.0 over each 12 month period.
# To normalize the monthly probability (i.e., they have to sum to 1.0 over 12 months), each
# monthly value has to be divided by the sum.  Constant parts (sum(cos(2*pi*m/P)) and sum(sin(2*pi*m/P),
# where sum is over all m (months) and P is period (6 months for Wermon and 12 months for JM)),
# need to be supplied as data as C_cos and C_sin. Also, C0 is a constant to make all Fourier 
# series values to be > 0.  I think C0 >= 2 should do... (not really... 10 did the trick)
#
# I used quite informative prior for X[1] ~ dnorm(5, 0.1) although variance of 10 should 
# be wide enough in the log scale.  I used similar priors for the slopes: dnorm(0, 0.1).
# For all standard deviations (process and observation), I used uniform between 0 and 20, 
# which should be wide enough in the log scale. 
#
# I didn't see any reason to make the priors flatter because that would make convergence difficult
# and did not gain anything in return.
